2. What is this plugin for?                               *fontcatalog-whatis*

        Some  people like  to use  Vim  in  a  terminal  window.  Simple still
        efficient.  Some people  use Vim in  the GUI.  Most,  maybe,  choose a
        single font and stick with it for a very long time.  Others, including
        my self,  like to  change font from time to  time,  or from session to
        session.  For this kind of people open the font list dialog every time
        he/she needs to choose another font may be boring or  cumbersome.  For
        this kind of people this plugin is for.

        This plugin enables you to choose a font from the font list dialog and
        set a  category for it.  A  category is simply  a name like  'bold' or
        'italic' with will be used to list fonts alike.  Maybe an example will
        clarify things better.

        I like the Consolas font. So I can load it using the font list dialog:
>
        :FCLoad
<
        Upon selected GUI Vim will start using it. It looks great on Windows
        but on Mac OS X it is a little heavy when used with dark background
        color schemes. So I put it in a category:
>
        :FCAdd regular bold italic heavy-on-dark
<
        Well,  that was  four categories:  'regular' because it  has a regular
        normal shape.  'bold' because it has a bold version.  MacVim is unable
        to fake  bold and italic  style so is  useful to have  categories that
        tell if a font has or not that style.  'italic' was also created thing
        in that matter.  Finally 'heavy-on-dark' because it is  a little heavy
        in dark backgrounds.

        The font 'Letter  Gothic Std Medium' has a  thin shape.  Good for dark
        backgrounds.  It also has  'bold' and 'italic' variants.  So  I put it
        on these categories:
>
        :FCAdd regular bold italic ok-on-dark
<
        Meaning this font is Ok on dark backgrounds. After I add several fonts
        to my categories I can list and set then in a more easily fashion:
>
        :FCFonts ok-on-dark
<
        Will list all fonts that I  put in that category.  Lets pretend that I
        want to use 'Letter Gothic Std Medium'.  I can type:
>
        :FCSet let<Tab>
<
        The name will be  completed for me.  I can change the  size if I want.
        Pressing <Enter> the chosen font will be set.

==============================================================================
3. Installing                                            *fontcatalog-install*

        Installation   is   very   simple.   There   are   just   two   files:
        'fontcatalog.vim' and 'fontcatalog.txt'.  Put 'fontcatalog.vim' in the
        plugins directory  and 'fontcatalog.txt'  in the  doc directory.  Open
        Vim and type:
>
        :helptags ~/.vim/doc
<
        Also,  a VimBall  file is provided.  You  can source 'fontcatalog.vmb'
        and files will be magically installed. Open that file on Vim and type:
>
        :so %
<
        And that is it.

==============================================================================
4. Options                                               *fontcatalog-options*

                                                        *'g:fc_CatalogFolder'*
        This  option  sets the  directory  where  categories  will  be stored.
        Categories  are really files that  lists all  fonts added  to it.  You
        should set this in your 'vimrc'  file because 'gvimrc' is loaded after
        the plugin it self.
>
        let g:fc_CatalogFolder = <default: ~/.vim/fontcatalog>
<
        The plugin will try to create this directory if it doesn't exist.


                                                          *'g:fc_DefaultFont'*
        This is  optional.  A font to be  used when GUI  Vim starts.  A string
        with the font name and size, like used in the option |'guifont'|.  You
        don't need to scape spaces.  The script does this automatically.
>
        let g:fc_DefaultFont = 'Letter Gothic Std Medium:h12'
<
        This also must  be set in 'vimrc' file.  'gvimrc'  will load after the
        plugin and it will not find this variable.

        When there is  no default font the  plugin will try to use  one from a
        previous session.  The  last  used  font,  if  there  is one,  will be
        selected.  Otherwise it  will let GUI Vim  to figure out  what font to
        use.


                                                      *'g:loaded_fontcatalog'*
        If you  wanna to  disable the  plugin to  load just  set this  in your
        'vimrc' file.
>
        let g:loaded_fontcatalog = 1
<
        The plugin will not load when this  variable is set and when no GUI is
        running.

==============================================================================
5. Commands                                             *fontcatalog-commands*

        exists it  will be  created.  You can add  the font  in more  than one
        category with a single command.

6. Mappings                                             *fontcatalog-mappings*

        There is no  mappings defined in the plugin.  You  can create your own
        if you need.  You can put your  mappings in the 'gvimrc' file since it
        is loaded after  the  plugin  is  load  and  the  commands are already
        available.

==============================================================================
7. ChangeLog                                             *fontcatalog-changes*

May 14, 2014 (version: 1.0.2)
    fontcatalog.vim
        * |:FCFont|, |:Font|: Now those commands shows the selected font
          specification when called without arguments.
        * |:FCCat|: Now this command accepts an argument allowing to get the
          categories of a font other than the selected one. It has the
          completion feature of listing all fonts in the catalog.
        * The selection of the startup font was moved to GUIEnter auto
          command.
    fontcatalog.txt
        * Documentation of |:FCRem| command updated.
        * Documentation of |:FCFont| and |:Font| commands updated.
        * Documentation of |:FCCat| command updated.

May 13, 2014:
        * fontcatalog.vim (version 1.0): First release.
        * fontcatalog.txt (version 1.0): First release.

==============================================================================
8. Todo                                                     *fontcatalog-todo*

        1)  Better  font selection  method.  Maybe  using  quickfix  window or
        something like that.
        2)  Script functions  could be  passed to  'autoload' directory.  Will
        speed up Vim loading time.
